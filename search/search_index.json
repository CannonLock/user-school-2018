            "text": "Travel To and From Madison\n\n\nWhether we offered to pay your travel costs or not, please make sure that we get a copy of your travel plans so that we\nknow when to expect you here and can plan accurately.  (If we offered to pay for your hotel room, we will make a room\nreservation and pay for the six nights of the schedule.)\n\n\nFind the numbered section below that applies to you:\n\n\n1. We Offered to Pay for Your Travel\n\n\nOur goal is to find reasonable and comfortable travel options for you to come to Madison and return home.  At the same\ntime, we must stay within our budget and follow all University of Wisconsin rules about arranging and paying for your\ntravel costs.  So let\ns work together to find something that makes sense for everyone.\n\n\nHere are a few ideas that have worked in the past to help some School travelers:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are less than 300 miles from Madison, consider driving; we can reimburse mileage and tolls up to a point.  Or\n  look into bus routes, especially from larger cities like Chicago.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you fly, it may be much cheaper to fly to Milwaukee (1\u00bd hours away) or Chicago (2\u00bd hours away), then take a direct\n  bus to Madison.  The buses are very comfortable, have wi-fi, and run frequently.  See below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso if you fly, be flexible about departure times \u2014 early and late flights are often the least expensive.  Now we do\n  not like very early or very late flights any more than you do, so we will work hard to find reasonable flight times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n Please try to complete your travel plans by early June, before rates go up significantly.\n\n\nTravel by Airplane\n\n\nDo NOT buy your own airline tickets\n.  University rules require that our travel\nagency, Fox World Travel (FWT), purchases your tickets.\n\n\nUse the following information to get air travel tickets:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGather your travel information: full legal name (as it is written on government IDs), date of birth, phone number;\n  travel dates and starting/ending location(s); and any travel preferences.  Then, contact Fox World Travel directly:\n\n\n\n\nBy email:\n send to \n and include your name (e.g., \nT. Cartwright\n) and\n  \nGroup Code 09UW2261\n in the subject line.\n\n\nBy phone:\n From the U.S., call 866-230-8787 toll free, or internationally, call +1\n920-230-6467.  Select\n  option 4, and tell them you are using \nGroup Code 09UW2261\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe must review and approve \nmost\n trips.  FWT is authorized to purchase tickets directly only in the easiest cases.\n  But if the FWT agent says that your trip must be reviewed, do not worry!  It just means that we need to check our\n  budget, make sure that we have considered all reasonable options, and are following all University rules.  Hopefully\n  we can approve your first choice, otherwise we will work with you and FWT to find one or more reasonable options.\n  Some common reasons for a trip needing review are: total trip cost over $475, travel starting and ending at different\n  locations, and travel on dates other than July 8 and 14.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApproval takes time, so it may take up to a day to get final confirmation.  Airplane tickets cannot be held without\n  purchase over a weekend, so it is best to avoid contacting FWT late on Fridays.  Also note that FWT and\n  UW\nMadison are closed on Monday, May 28, for Memorial Day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease be considerate of the FWT agent(s) you work with.  They work hard to find good options for you, but they must\n  also follow our rules.  If you feel that they are not providing the options that you want, you should email us.  We\n  will try to understand the options that you want and that FWT is providing, and help resolve any issues.  Do not argue\n  with the FWT agents, especially about options you find online\n there are many reasons why that option\n  might not be available to us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel by Bus\n\n\nFor some nearby locations, or in addition to air travel to Chicago or Milwaukee, it may be helpful to take a bus to\nMadison.  Bus companies that School travelers have used a great deal in the past are:\n\n\n\n\nVan Galder Bus\n, especially from Chicago\n\n\nBadger Bus\n, especially from Milwaukee\n\n\n\n\nYou may purchase bus tickets through Fox World Travel (FWT):\n\n\n\n\nBy email:\n send to \n and include your name (e.g., \nT. Cartwright\n) and\n  \nGroup Code 09UW2261\n in the subject line.\n\n\nBy phone:\n From the U.S., call 866-230-8787 toll free, or internationally, call +1\n920-230-6467.  Select\n  option 4, and tell them you are using \nGroup Code 09UW2261\n\n\n\n\nOr for maximum flexibility, you may purchase bus tickets yourself \nbefore or on\n the day of travel.  If you purchase\nyour own tickets, you must get our approval for the estimated cost first, then request reimbursement from us after the\nSchool.\n\n\nIf you purchase your own tickets, save the original receipt (even if by email).  It is best to have a detailed receipt\n(including your name, itinerary, date of purchase, and total amount paid), but a regular ticket stub (e.g., without your\nname or date) should work fine.  Just get what you can!\n\n\nBe sure to email us with your bus plans, including:\n\n\n\n\nTransportation provider(s) (e.g., Van Galder bus)\n\n\nArrival date and approximate time\n\n\nDeparture date and approximate time\n\n\nArrival and departure location within Madison\n\n\nActual or estimated cost (indicate which)\n\n\n\n\nTravel by Personal Car\n\n\nIf you are driving to Madison, you will be reimbursed the mileage rate of $0.545/mile for the round-trip distance (as\ncalculated by Google Maps), plus tolls.  Also, we will pay for parking costs for the week at the hotel in Madison (but\nnot elsewhere).  It may help to keep your receipts for tolls.\n\n\nNote: Due to the high mileage reimbursement rate, driving can be an expensive option!  We reserve the right to limit\nyour total driving reimbursement, so work with us on the details.\n\n\nTo travel by personal car, please check with us first.  We may search for comparable flight options, to make sure that\ndriving is indeed the least expensive method.\n\n\nBe sure to email us with your travel plans as soon as possible.  Try to include:\n\n\n\n\nDeparture date from home, location (for mileage calculation), and approximate time of arrival in Madison\n\n\nDeparture date and approximate time from Madison, and return location (for mileage calculation) if different than above\n\n\n\n\n2. You Are Paying for Your Travel\n\n\nIf you are paying for your own travel or if someone else is paying for it, go ahead and make your travel arrangements\nnow!  Just remember to arrive on Sunday, July 8, before 6pm and depart on Saturday, July 14 (or else check with us\nfirst).\n\n\nBe sure to email us with your travel plans as soon as possible.  Try to include:\n\n\n\n\nTransportation provider(s) (e.g., airline)\n\n\nArrival date and approximate time\n\n\nDeparture date and approximate time\n\n\nArrival and departure location within Madison (e.g., airport, bus station, etc.)",

At the same\ntime, we must stay within our budget and follow all University of Wisconsin rules about arranging and paying for your\ntravel costs.  So let s work together to find something that makes sense for everyone.  Here are a few ideas that have worked in the past to help some School travelers:    If you are less than 300 miles from Madison, consider driving; we can reimburse mileage and tolls up to a point.  Or\n  look into bus routes, especially from larger cities like Chicago.    If you fly, it may be much cheaper to fly to Milwaukee (1\u00bd hours away) or Chicago (2\u00bd hours away), then take a direct\n  bus to Madison.  The buses are very comfortable, have wi-fi, and run frequently.  See below.    Also if you fly, be flexible about departure times \u2014 early and late flights are often the least expensive.  Now we do\n  not like very early or very late flights any more than you do, so we will work hard to find reasonable flight times.    Note:  Please try to complete your travel plans by early June, before rates go up significantly.",

FWT is authorized to purchase tickets directly only in the easiest cases.\n  But if the FWT agent says that your trip must be reviewed, do not worry!  It just means that we need to check our\n  budget, make sure that we have considered all reasonable options, and are following all University rules.  Hopefully\n  we can approve your first choice, otherwise we will work with you and FWT to find one or more reasonable options.\n  Some common reasons for a trip needing review are: total trip cost over $475, travel starting and ending at different\n  locations, and travel on dates other than July 8 and 14.    Approval takes time, so it may take up to a day to get final confirmation.  Airplane tickets cannot be held without\n  purchase over a weekend, so it is best to avoid contacting FWT late on Fridays.  Also note that FWT and\n  UW Madison are closed on Monday, May 28, for Memorial Day.    Please be considerate of the FWT agent(s) you work with.  They work hard to find good options for you, but they must\n  also follow our rules.  If you feel that they are not providing the options that you want, you should email us.  We\n  will try to understand the options that you want and that FWT is providing, and help resolve any issues.  Do not argue\n  with the FWT agents, especially about options you find online  there are many reasons why that option\n  might not be available to us.",
